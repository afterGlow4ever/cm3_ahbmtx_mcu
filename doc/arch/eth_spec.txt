ETH MAC Feature:

ETH MAC DATA BUFFER AHB MASTER FEATURE:
1. Supporting single or 4-burst data read and write transferring.
2. Supporting hready timeout and hresp error detection.
3. Only supporting 32 bits transfering. 8, 16, 24 bits are not supporting.

ETH MAC TX DATA BUFFER FEATURE:
1. 2k rams for data cache.
2. Supporting pingpong operation.
3. 4 descriptors for tx data.

ETH MAC TX PE FEATURE:
1. Supporting hardware padding and crc.
2. Supporting hardware checksum for ip, tcp, udp, icmp frames.
3. Supporting hardware source mac address insertion.
4. Supporting bus operation and tx data simultaneously but without hardware checksum and mac address.
5. RGMII interface for 10MHz & 100MHz.
6. Supporting up to 2048 bytes frame.
7. Supporting configurable length of preamble and frame interval.

Note: 
1. Auto-retransmission is reserved for future.
2. Tx error signal is reserved for future.
3. Collision detection is reserved for future.


This tx handle module will only handle data in eth frame excluding padding or crc.

1. All data will be pushed into cache for hardware checksum in headers and then be poped to transmit.(Using hardware checksum)
State: cache in-> cache checksum -> cache out
2. All data will be pushed into cache for cache and may be used in auto-retransmission.(Using software checksum)
State: bypass(normal trasmission)
State: cacheout(auto-retransmission)
